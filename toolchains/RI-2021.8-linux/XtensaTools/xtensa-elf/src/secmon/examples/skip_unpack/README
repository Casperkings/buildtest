The "skip_unpack" example is unique in that it uses a different build process
than other exmamples:

- xt-elf2rom is not called, and binary files are not generated.

- The nonsecure application is loaded (--load=nonsecure_app-board.exe) as an ELF 
file, not a binary file.

- During secmon boot-up, no unpacking is done, as the secmon_unpack() function
is overridden in secure_user_init.c.

- When running the test on ISS, the nonsecure application's entry point is 
passed to secmon as a command-line parameter, which ISS forwards to 
secmon_unpack(). 

- When running on remote targets, run "load nonsecure_app-board.exe" prior to
"load", then set the nonsecure _start address as the secmon parameter using 
"set-args --address=<argsaddr> <_startaddr>".  Note that the parameter does not
include the "unpack=" string common to other tests.
