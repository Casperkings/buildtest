The trax software library is meant to be used in order to give the user the 
ability to control and access TRAX so that a tensilica core can set triggers 
and read the data

The library contains the API to deal with TRAX. It is similar to the API 
offered by xt-traxcmd. But in this case, we read and write registers 
directly using wer and rer instructions.

The files are:

trax.c		: This file contains the basic implementation of the 
		  library commands with their helper functions
trax.h		: A header file that contains the API calls that can 
		  be made by the user
trax-proto.c	: This contains the low level protocol implementation
		  of reading and writing memory and registers. The
		  end user need not be concerned with these details
trax-util.c	: This file contains utility functions that can be used for 
		  polling TRAX or executing higher level save functionality. 
		  It assumes that print subroutines and file I/O routines are
		  available on the system allocating spaces for saving the 
		  trace, etc.
Makefile.in	: The makefile for the build process
		  xmake all install shall build the library
