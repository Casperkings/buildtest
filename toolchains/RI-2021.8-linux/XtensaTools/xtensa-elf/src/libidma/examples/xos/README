These examples demonstrate the use of libdma functions from multiple
threads using XOS. Both create 3 threads each of which schedules its
own set of DMA descriptors. All threads share the same channel, and
the transfers are scheduled in FIFO order.

 xos_fixedbuf.c -- uses fixed-buffer mode
 xos_taskmode.c -- uses task mode

To build the tests, use the command line examples below or alter them
to suit your preferences -

    xt-clang -O2 -g xos_fixedbuf.c -lidma-os -lxos -lxtutil -I..

    xt-clang -O2 -g xos_taskmode.c -lidma-os -lxos -lxtutil -I..

The "-I.." is needed to be able to include <idma_tests.h> from the
parent directory.

IMPORTANT: In task mode, the task buffer must have all descriptors filled
in before the task is scheduled. i.e. if you allocated a task buffer with
4 descriptors, you must add 4 descriptors before calling idma_schedule_task().
