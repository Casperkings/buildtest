    Instructions for rebuilding the libidma library
    ===============================================

The libidma library can be rebuilt if necessary, following the instructions
below. The rebuild must be done using command-line tools only. The Xtensa
toolchain must be installed and configured properly beforehand.

 - Open a command shell (Windows) or terminal window (Linux). You can open
   this directly from the Xplorer GUI by right-clicking on the desired
   configuration in the System Overview window. If you open from Xplorer then
   the environment will be set up correctly for you. If you do it manually then
   make sure that the path and environment variables are set up correctly
   for the Xtensa tools and your chosen configuration.

 - Change directory to the location where the libidma sources are present.
   (This file should have been present in the same location).

 - The command "xt-make -f Makefile.src all" will build all the available
   variants of the library. By default, the generated files go into a
   subdirectory "bin" of the current working directory. The following make
   variables can be specified on the command line (or set in the environment)
   to override the default settings -

   BINDIR -- the build output (.o files and .a files) go here.
   SRCDIR -- location of the source files.

   CC_FOR_TARGET -- the compiler to use. The default is "xt-clang". Either
                    xt-clang or xt-xcc can be used. By default, "-std=c11"
                    is used with the Xtensa C Library (xclib) and "-std=c99"
                    with newlib.

 - Do not override the CFLAGS make variable directly. Some of the things
   included in the default CFLAGS are required. Define CFLAGS_EXTRA or edit
   the makefile to change the compiler options directly if desired.

 - The library (.a) files can be copied to their final location after the
   build has completed.

 - If you have changed any of the source or header files, then verifying
   correct operation of the resulting library is your responsibility.
